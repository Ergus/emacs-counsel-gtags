[GNU GLOBAL](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/) interface of [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper).

## Tasks

- [X] Basic commands
- [X] find file command
- [X] Tag command
- [ ] Context command(dwim)
 - [X] Find definition and references
 - [ ] include header support
- [ ] `GTAGSLIBPATH` support
- [X] Basic History command
- [ ] History navigate command
- [x] Tramp support

## Requirements

- Emacs 24.3 or higher versions
- [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)
- GNU global 6.2.3 or higher versions

## Installation

`counsel-gtags` is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) and [MELPA stable](https://stable.melpa.org/)

You can install `counsel-gtags` with the following command.

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] counsel-gtags [RET]</kbd>

## Basic Usage

You can search for tags or files in the database. Every time you jump to a
definition, reference or symbol the current position is pushed to the context
stack. You can navigate backward and forward within this stack with
`counsel-gtags-go-backward` and `counsel-gtags-go-forward`.

#### counsel-gtags-find-definition

Search for definition.

#### counsel-gtags-find-reference

Search for references.

#### counsel-gtags-find-symbol

Search for symbol references.

#### counsel-gtags-find-file

Search for file among tagged files.

#### counsel-gtags-go-backward

Go to previous position in context stack.

#### counsel-gtags-go-forward

Go to next position in context stack.

#### counsel-gtags-create-tags

Create GNU GLOBAL tags.

#### counsel-gtags-update-tags

Update tags.

#### counsel-gtags-dwim

Find name by context.

- Jump to tag definition if cursor is on tag reference
- Jump to tag reference if cursor is on tag definition

### Other window commands

There are also the commands:
- counsel-gtags-find-definition-other-window
- counsel-gtags-find-reference-other-window
- counsel-gtags-find-symbol-other-window
- counsel-gtags-find-file-other-window

Similar to the mentioned before with similar names but use other
windows instead of the same. This functionality is also available
throw `ivy-actions` in the candidates list pressing `M-o j`.

## Sample Configuration

```lisp
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'counsel-gtags-mode)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'counsel-gtags-mode)

(with-eval-after-load 'counsel-gtags
  (define-key counsel-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-t") 'counsel-gtags-find-definition)
  (define-key counsel-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-r") 'counsel-gtags-find-reference)
  (define-key counsel-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-s") 'counsel-gtags-find-symbol)
  (define-key counsel-gtags-mode-map (kbd "M-,") 'counsel-gtags-go-backward))
```

A simpler alternative to the previous configuration is to use the
included `counsel-gtags-command-map` which has all the interactive
commands already defined. If you want to use that map you only need to
define a prefix for it.

```lisp
(define-key counsel-gtags-mode-map (kbd ...) #'counsel-gtags-command-map)
```
Or if you have `use-packages` and prefer autoloads.

```lisp
(use-package counsel-gtags
	:bind-keymap ("C-c g" . counsel-gtags-command-map)
	:config
	(counsel-gtags-mode 1))
```

There are some useful custom variables like

- counsel-gtags-use-input-at-point: To use `thing-at-point` functions.

- counsel-gtags-debug-mode : To enable debug mode which prints some of
  the commands in the \*Messages\* buffer.

- counsel-gtags-use-dynamic-list:
  > When this option is `non-nil` the
  list of candidates will be filtered externally with a `grep` command
  and use **ivy-read :dynamic t**; so every change in the input will
  call the external process to update candidates list.

  > When counsel-gtags-use-dynamic-list is nil the candidates list
  from **grep -c** is passed to emacs without any filter and the
  filtering is made with `ivy-read` command, the external process is
  called only once per invocation, but the list may be too large in
  some projects.  This option is recommended when using tramp and slow
  connections and/or the expected output of **global -c** is not extremely
  large.
  
  > In my use case, `nil` performs better when using tramp and **global
  -c** in the remote host returns ~5000 candidates. When working
  locally it also performs better in most of the cases.

My other "using global from withing Emacs" package: [global-tags.el](https://launchpad.net/global-tags.el)
I stopped using this package (, created) and started using that one, which works best with [ivy-xref](https://github.com/alexmurray/ivy-xref). This package and [global-gtags](https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags) are really hard to maintain because newcomers have to absorb a lot of hacks so the code can work.

This packages is mostly "make things friendly for ivy", while `global-gtags` is mostly "fight compilation-mode to present a decent UI". None use Emacs' native `xref.el`.
